# Trex
Trex project from Whitehat Jr.
This is a change to the README -- a file that is included with the project that has descriptions, instrutions and credits; on a branch -- a copy of the main program for testing and editing before making changes to the main branch; that will be committed -- a change that is saved on a branch -- and then merged with the main branch via a pull request, that highlights the differences in branches and the contributor who requests the merging. I think.
